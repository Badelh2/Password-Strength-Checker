Welcome to the Password Strength Checker!

This is a Python script that checks the strength of a password and gives it a score based on a set of rules. The higher the score, the stronger the password.

Password Rules

The following rules are used to determine the strength of a password:

    Passwords must be at least 7 characters long
    Passwords must contain at least 1 lowercase letter, 1 uppercase letter, 1 number and 1 special digit
    Passwords should not contain any common words or phrases
